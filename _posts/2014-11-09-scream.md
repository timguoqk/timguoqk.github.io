*My first hackathon project.*

Struggling with midterms? Celebrating a football touchdown? ...and don' want to be kicked out by roommate for making noise?

For some of our emotions, all and only it takes to express is screaming. The voice of Siri can help you do that!

Highlight of Features:

- Location-based
- Convert text input to synthesized voice with customized pitch
- Post a photo with screaming
- Schedule specific time after which the post will appear in newsfeed
- Totally Anonymous
- Reply to others also by screaming
