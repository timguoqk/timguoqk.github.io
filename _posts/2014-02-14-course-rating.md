This is my first Ruby on Rails project back in high school. I learned RoR in about three weeks and this website was built in a week. But the code was written with good practice and great tools (Postgres, SASS, Git, etc.). The site is robust the the design is resposive.

The server expired and data is lost. Now I only have some screenshots of this site.
