Visual Silencing Illusion, according to its creator, is a new illusion that shows it's hard to notice when moving objects change. [The original illusion](http://visionlab.harvard.edu/silencing/) uses a fine-tuned video sequence, while I created an interactive website that allow users to adjust the parameters easily.

The website uses BonsaiJS and web worker.
