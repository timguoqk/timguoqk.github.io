Hi I'm Tim. I study computer science and psychology at Brown University.

I've been coding for a long time and I aspire to build a better way to interact with the digital world.

This website is a work in progress. All the CSS and JS are written myself, based on this [mockup](https://www.dropbox.com/s/a70aqc40lcwkjy4/mockup.sketch?dl=0) in Sketch.
